$ARGUMENTS

Evaluation order from broad/flexible to specific and strict. It needs to be a
clean funnel so that every evaluation point works toward correct grammatical
output while following and validating and requiring every rule that exists to
be followed. The intention is to force the model through a structured thought
process using the XML tags. Only the update tag is actually evaluated; all
other tags are for model guidance.

It needs to be clear and concise instructions using bullets without summaries
or duplicate meaning. This is for artificial intelligence guidance, not for
human interpretation. Show me the suggested change by performing the edit and I
will either accept or deny with guidance.
